# Technical Reference: System Architecture

This document provides a more detailed, technical overview of the components and architecture of the underwriting analysis system.

## High-Level Architecture

The system is composed of four main components, each designed to be modular and independently scalable. This separation of concerns is key to the system's flexibility, allowing individual components to be upgraded or replaced without impacting the rest of the system.

### 1. Mock API (`api_mock`)

- **Purpose**: Mock implementation of a subset of the Flinks API. It allows a user to either access the frontend and download the CSV files for a given customer, or request the data via the API. For comprehensive API documentation with detailed endpoints and curl examples, see `docs/api_mock.md`.
- **Technology**: A Flask-based API that serves mock bank statement data from CSV files.
- **Production Strategy**: These pipelines can be easily migrated to a production environment and deployed on a cloud-based workflow orchestrator like Apache Airflow or Prefect. The data lake itself would be moved to a cloud storage solution like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

### 2. Data Pipelines (`pipelines`)

- **Purpose**: A set of robust data pipelines responsible for ingesting, cleaning, and transforming the raw data into a usable format.
- **Technology**: The pipelines are built using Python with `deltalake` and `pandas`, processing data in stages and storing the output in a local, transactional data lake.
- **Architecture**: The data lake is located at the root directory at the location `data_lake/` and follows a standard multi-hop architecture:
    - **Bronze Layer**: Raw, unprocessed data is landed here from the source API.
    - **Silver Layer**: Data is cleaned, standardized, and enriched.
    - **Application Status Ledger**: A dedicated table (`application_status_ledger`) tracks the state of each application through the workflow.
- **Key Feature: Idempotency & ACID Transactions**: The entire data lake is built on **Delta Lake**. Instead of manual state management, the pipelines leverage atomic `MERGE` operations. This provides ACID guarantees and ensures that every pipeline run is idempotent, preventing data duplication and corruption. This is a modern, industry-standard approach to building reliable data platforms.
- **Production Strategy**: These pipelines can be easily migrated to a production environment and deployed on a cloud-based workflow orchestrator like Apache Airflow or Prefect. The data lake itself would be moved to a cloud storage solution like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

### 3. Analytics (`analytics`)

- **Purpose**: This component is responsible for running analytics on the cleaned data to generate insights and features for the credit scoring model.
- **Technology**: A dbt (Data Build Tool) project that uses DuckDB as its data warehouse. This allows for rapid, SQL-based development of data models and transformations on the local Parquet files.
- **Production Strategy**: In a production setting, this dbt project would be reconfigured to connect to a cloud data warehouse like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift, enabling it to handle much larger datasets and more complex analytical workloads.

### 4. Taktile (Hypothetical)

- **Purpose**: This future component will be responsible for the final credit decisioning.
- **Implementation Plan**: It will take the features generated by the analytics layer and send them to a decisioning engine (like Taktile) to get a credit score and recommendation. The results will then be stored back in our data warehouse for analysis and monitoring.

## Path to Production

The current prototype is fully functional for local development and testing. The following steps outline the path to a full production deployment:

1.  **Swap the Mock API**: Reconfigure the API client to connect to the live Flinks API.
2.  **Deploy Pipelines**: Deploy the data pipelines to a workflow orchestrator like **Apache Airflow** for scheduled, reliable execution.
3.  **Scale the Data Lake**: Migrate the data lake from local storage to a cloud object store like **Amazon S3** or **Google Cloud Storage**.
4.  **Upgrade the Data Warehouse**: Transition the analytics from DuckDB to a production data warehouse like **Snowflake**, **BigQuery**, or **Redshift** to handle large-scale data.
5.  **Implement the Decisioning Logic**: Build out the Taktile integration to connect the feature data to the live decisioning engine.
