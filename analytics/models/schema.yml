  - name: stg_transactions
    description: "This model is the entry point for raw transaction data into the dbt project. It directly reads the 'silver' layer of the data lake, which contains the combined, cleansed, and deduplicated transaction data from all source bank statements. The data is loaded from the Silver Delta table using DuckDB's `delta_scan()` function, which efficiently reads the latest version of the data directly from the Delta Lake transaction log. This process is orchestrated by the `transform_statements.py` pipeline, which reads from the Bronze layer, cleans the data, and merges it into the Silver table, ensuring data integrity and idempotency. This model serves as the foundational source table for all downstream analysis and financial metric calculations."

  - name: int_transactions_enriched
    description: "This model is the foundational table for all customer transactions. It reads from the `statements` model and enriches the data with key analytical columns. The model's primary logic involves using a window function to determine the most recent transaction date for each data pull (`request_id`), which serves as a consistent anchor for time-based calculations. It then casts data to the correct types, creates boolean flags for revenue and debits, and generates a series of lookback date columns (e.g., last 30, 90, 180, 365 days) to simplify downstream financial metric calculations. This table serves as the primary source for all subsequent analysis."
